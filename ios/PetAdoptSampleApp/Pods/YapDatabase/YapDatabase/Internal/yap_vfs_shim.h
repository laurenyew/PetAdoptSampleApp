 * From the SQLite Docs:
 * 
 * > From the point of view of the uppers layers of the SQLite stack, each open database file uses exactly one VFS.
 * > But in practice, a particular VFS might just be a thin wrapper around another VFS that does the real work.
 * > We call a wrapper VFS a "shim".
 * > 
 * > A simple example of a shim is the "vfstrace" VFS. This is a VFS (implemented in the test_vfstrace.c source file)
 * > that writes a message associated with each VFS method call into a log file,
 * > then passes control off to another VFS to do the actual work.
 * 
 * The yap_vfs_shim provides a "shim" around a real VFS.
 * It's designed to provide additional functionality for YapDatabaseConnection.
