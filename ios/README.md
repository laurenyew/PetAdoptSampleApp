## Steps to build the app

To build and use this app yourself with the petfinder API,
Follow the [Getting Authenticated](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/v2/docs/) steps on the Petfinder.com website to create an account and API key with access token. 
Add your access token to a new file `~/accessTokens/petfinderAccessToken`. This is a hidden file not included with this public repo that will be included in the build steps in order for the app to access the petfinder API.
